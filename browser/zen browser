This documentation provides a streamlined, developer-friendly guide to deploying the Zen Browser container. This setup utilizes KasmVNC to render a full browser GUI directly within your web browser.

Deploying Zen Browser via Docker
1. Environment Verification
Before initializing the container, ensure your Docker daemon is active and your user permissions are correctly configured.

Check Docker Status
On Debian-based (Ubuntu) or RHEL-based (Fedora/AlmaLinux) systems, use systemctl to verify the service status:

Bash

# Check if Docker is active
sudo systemctl status docker

# If inactive, start the service
sudo systemctl start docker
Identify User Permissions
LinuxServer.io images require matching the container's internal user to your host user to prevent permission issues with saved data. Find your IDs by running:

Bash

id
PUID: Typically 1000 (Your User ID).

PGID: Typically 1000 (Your Group ID).

2. Initialization: Image Acquisition
"Pulling" the image downloads the necessary layers from the registry to your local machine.

Bash

docker pull lscr.io/linuxserver/zen:latest
3. Configuration & Persistent Storage
Docker containers are ephemeral by default; any bookmarks or settings will be lost if the container is removed. To prevent this, you must initialize a local directory to map as a Volume.

Bash

# Create a hidden or dedicated config folder in your home directory
mkdir -p ~/zen-config
4. Full Deployment Command
This multiline command initializes the container with the necessary security options and hardware allocations.

Bash

docker run -d \
  --name=zen-browser \
  --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -e TZ=Etc/UTC \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -p 3001:3001 \
  -v ~/zen-config:/config \
  --shm-size="1gb" \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  lscr.io/linuxserver/zen:latest
Detailed Flag Documentation
--security-opt seccomp=unconfined: Required for Chromium-based browsers (like Zen) to allow the internal sandbox to function correctly within the Docker container.

-p 3000:3000: Maps the web-based GUI to your local port 3000.

-v ~/zen-config:/config: Bridges your local folder to the container, ensuring browser profiles and history persist through restarts.

--shm-size="1gb": Allocates shared memory to prevent the browser from crashing when loading heavy media or multiple tabs.

--restart unless-stopped: Configures the Docker engine to automatically restart the browser if the host machine reboots.

5. Verification & Access
Once deployed, verify the container is active and accessible.

Check Running Processes: Run docker ps to see the container's status and uptime.

Access the GUI: Open your local web browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:3000

Authentication: If prompted, the default KasmVNC interface usually does not require a password unless specifically configured in the environment variables.
